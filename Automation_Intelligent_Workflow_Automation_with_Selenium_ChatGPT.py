# There are more examples of using Python and Selenium for various automation tasks, including ones that utilizes ChatGPT for code conversion and 
# other examples that incorporate AI in different ways:

import selenium
from chatgpt_api import generate_workflow_steps

# Initialize Selenium driver
driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()

# Define the task
task = "Book a flight from New York to San Francisco"

# Use ChatGPT API to generate workflow steps
workflow_steps = generate_workflow_steps(task)

# Execute the workflow steps
for step in workflow_steps:
    # Perform actions based on the step
    if step.startswith("Navigate to"):
        driver.get(step.split(" ")[-1])
    elif step.startswith("Click"):
        element = driver.find_element_by_...
        element.click()
    elif step.startswith("Type"):
        element = driver.find_element_by_...
        element.send_keys(step.split(" ", 1)[1
