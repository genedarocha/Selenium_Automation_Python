# Description - Automated_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Selenium_and_ChatGPT - Python Script/Code that   
# Change: Added New Script/Code for Automated_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Selenium_and_ChatGPT
# Date  : "17.03.2024"
# Version: 1.0 
# More Information : These examples cover a wide range of automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, including automated testing, data entry, 
# job applications, price monitoring, social media interactions, email checking, form filling, survey completion, captcha solving, 
# browser extensions installation, video playback, and file downloads. 
# Further Examples include: examples cover various advanced automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, 
# including web performance testing, visual testing, parallel test execution, browser configuration, web crawling, web application testing, 
# browser fingerprinting, and screenshot stitching
# There are more examples of using Python and Selenium for various automation tasks, including ones that utilizes ChatGPT for code conversion and 
# other examples that incorporate AI in different ways:

import selenium
from chatgpt_api import generate_action
import random

# Initialize Selenium driver
driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Define the reward function
def reward_function(state):
    # Calculate the reward based on the current state
    # ...
    return reward

# Define the initial state
state = driver.execute_script("return document.documentElement.outerHTML")

# Train the agent
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    done = False
    total_reward = 0

    while not done:
        # Use ChatGPT API to generate the next action
        action = generate_action(state)

        # Execute the action using Selenium
        if action == "click":
            element = driver.find_element_by_...
            element.click()
        elif action == "type":
            element = driver.find_element_by_...
            element.send_keys("...")
        # ...

        # Get the new state and reward
        new_state = driver.execute_script("return document.documentElement.outerHTML")
        reward = reward_function(new_state)
        total_reward += reward

        # Update the agent's policy
        # ...

        state = new_state

    # Log the episode's total reward
    print(f"Episode {episode}: Total reward = {total_reward}")
