# Description - Automated_Conversational_UI_Testing_with_Selenium_and_ChatGPT - Python Script/Code that shows how to test a conversational UI using Selenium and ChatGPT
# Change: Added New Script/Code for Automated_Conversational_UI_Testing_with_Selenium_and_ChatGPT  
# Date  : "17.03.2024"
# Version: 1.0 
# More Information : These examples cover a wide range of automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, including automated testing, data entry, 
# job applications, price monitoring, social media interactions, email checking, form filling, survey completion, captcha solving, 
# browser extensions installation, video playback, and file downloads. 
# Further Examples include: examples cover various advanced automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, 
# including web performance testing, visual testing, parallel test execution, browser configuration, web crawling, web application testing, 
# browser fingerprinting, and screenshot stitching
# There are more examples of using Python and Selenium for various automation tasks, including ones that utilizes ChatGPT for code conversion and 
# other examples that incorporate AI in different ways:

import selenium
from chatgpt_api import generate_response

# Initialize Selenium driver
driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the conversational UI
driver.get("https://example.com/chatbot")

# Define test scenarios
test_scenarios = [
    "Book a flight to New York",
    "Check account balance",
    "Schedule a doctor's appointment",
    # ...
]

# Execute test scenarios
for scenario in test_scenarios:
    # Simulate user input
    user_input = driver.find_element_by_id("user-input")
    user_input.send_keys(scenario)
    user_input.submit()

    # Get the chatbot response
    response_element = driver.find_element_by_id("response")
    response = response_element.text

    # Use ChatGPT API to evaluate the response
    evaluation = generate_response(f"Evaluate the following response for '{scenario}': {response}")
    print(evaluation)
