# Description - Automated_Continuous_Performance_Testing_with_Selenium_ChatGPT - Python Script/Code to perform automated continuous performance testing using Selenium and ChatGPT
# Change: Added New Script/Code for Automated_Continuous_Performance_Testing_with_Selenium_ChatGPT
# Date  : "17.03.2024"
# Version: 1.0 
# More Information : These examples cover a wide range of automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, including automated testing, data entry, 
# job applications, price monitoring, social media interactions, email checking, form filling, survey completion, captcha solving, 
# browser extensions installation, video playback, and file downloads. 
# Further Examples include: examples cover various advanced automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, 
# including web performance testing, visual testing, parallel test execution, browser configuration, web crawling, web application testing, 
# browser fingerprinting, and screenshot stitching
# There are more examples of using Python and Selenium for various automation tasks, including ones that utilizes ChatGPT for code conversion and 
# other examples that incorporate AI in different ways:

import selenium

from chatgpt_api import analyze_performance
import time

# Initialize Selenium driver
driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Start the performance testing loop
while True:
    # Record the start time
    start_time = time.time()

    # Perform a series of actions
    driver.find_element_by_...
    driver.find_element_by_...
    # ...

    # Record the end time
    end_time = time.time()

    # Calculate the total time taken
    total_time = end_time - start_time

    # Use ChatGPT API to analyze the performance
    performance_analysis = analyze_performance(total_time)
    print(performance_analysis)

    # Wait for a specified interval before the next iteration
    time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 1 minute
