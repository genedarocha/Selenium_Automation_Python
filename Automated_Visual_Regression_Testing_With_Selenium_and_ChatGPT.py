import selenium
from chatgpt_api import compare_images
import cv2

# Initialize Selenium driver
driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Take a screenshot of the current state
screenshot = driver.get_screenshot_as_png()

# Load the expected image
expected_image = cv2.imread("expected.png")

# Use ChatGPT API to compare the images
comparison_result = compare_images(screenshot, expected_image)

# Print the comparison result
print(comparison_result)
