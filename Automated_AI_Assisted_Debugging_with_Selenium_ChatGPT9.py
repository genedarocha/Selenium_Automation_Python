# browser fingerprinting, and screenshot stitching
# There are more examples of using Python and Selenium for various automation tasks, including ones that utilizes ChatGPT for code conversion and 
# other examples that incorporate AI in different ways:

import selenium
from chatgpt_api import debug_code

# Initialize Selenium driver
driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Get the page source code
page_source = driver.page_source

# Use ChatGPT API to debug the code
debugging_results = debug_code(page_source)

# Print the debugging results
print(debugging_results)
