# Description - Automated_Crowd_Sourced_Testing_With_Selenium_Chatgbt - Python Script/Code to perform automated crowd-sourced testing using Selenium and ChatGPT
# Change: Added New Script/Code for Automated_Continuous_Performance_Testing_with_Selenium_ChatGPT
# Date  : "17.03.2024"
# Version: 1.0 
# More Information : These examples cover a wide range of automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, including automated testing, data entry, 
# job applications, price monitoring, social media interactions, email checking, form filling, survey completion, captcha solving, 
# browser extensions installation, video playback, and file downloads. 
# Further Examples include: examples cover various advanced automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, 
# including web performance testing, visual testing, parallel test execution, browser configuration, web crawling, web application testing, 
# browser fingerprinting, and screenshot stitching
# There are more examples of using Python and Selenium for various automation tasks, including ones that utilizes ChatGPT for code conversion and 
# other examples that incorporate AI in different ways:

import selenium
from chatgpt_api import generate_test_cases

# Initialize Selenium driver
driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Use ChatGPT API to generate test cases based on crowd-sourced inputs
crowd_inputs = [
    "Test the login functionality with different combinations of valid and invalid credentials",
    "Verify that the search results are relevant and sorted correctly",
    "Check the accessibility of the website for users with disabilities",
    # ...
]

test_cases = []
for input_text in crowd_inputs:
    test_cases.extend(generate_test_cases(input_text))

# Execute the generated test cases
for test_case in test_cases:
    # Perform test steps using Selenium
    # ...

    # Evaluate test results
    # ...
