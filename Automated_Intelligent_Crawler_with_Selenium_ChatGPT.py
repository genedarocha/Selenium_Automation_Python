# Change: Added New Script/Code for Automated_Intelligent_Crawler_with_Selenium_ChatGPT
# Date  : "17.03.2024"
# Version: 1.0 
# More Information : These examples cover a wide range of automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, including automated testing, data entry, 
# job applications, price monitoring, social media interactions, email checking, form filling, survey completion, captcha solving, 
# browser extensions installation, video playback, and file downloads. 
# Further Examples include: examples cover various advanced automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, 
# including web performance testing, visual testing, parallel test execution, browser configuration, web crawling, web application testing, 
# browser fingerprinting, and screenshot stitching
# There are more examples of using Python and Selenium for various automation tasks, including ones that utilizes ChatGPT for code conversion and 
# other examples that incorporate AI in different ways:

import selenium
from chatgpt_api import generate_instructions
from collections import deque

# Initialize Selenium driver
driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()

# Define the starting URL
start_url = "https://example.com"

# Initialize the URL queue
url_queue = deque([start_url])

# Crawl the website
while url_queue:
    # Get the next URL from the queue
    current_url = url_queue.popleft()

    # Navigate to the URL
    driver.get(current_url)

    # Use ChatGPT API to generate instructions for crawling
    instructions = generate_instructions(driver.page_source)

    # Execute the instructions
    for instruction in instructions:
        if instruction.startswith("Click"):
            element = driver.find_element_by_...
            element.click()
            url_queue.append(driver.current_url)
        elif instruction.startswith("Extract"):
            # Extract data from the page
            # ...
        # ...
