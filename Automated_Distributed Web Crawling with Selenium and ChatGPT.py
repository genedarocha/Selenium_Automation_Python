# Description - Automated Distributed Web Crawling with Selenium and ChatGPT - Python Script/Code to perform automated distributed web crawling using Selenium and ChatGPT
# Change: Added New Script/Code for Automated Distributed Web Crawling with Selenium and ChatGPT
# Date  : "17.03.2024"
# Version: 1.0 
# More Information : These examples cover a wide range of automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, including automated testing, data entry, 
# job applications, price monitoring, social media interactions, email checking, form filling, survey completion, captcha solving, 
# browser extensions installation, video playback, and file downloads. 
# Further Examples include: examples cover various advanced automation scenarios using Selenium and Python, 
# including web performance testing, visual testing, parallel test execution, browser configuration, web crawling, web application testing, 
# browser fingerprinting, and screenshot stitching
# There are more examples of using Python and Selenium for various automation tasks, including ones that utilizes ChatGPT for code conversion and 
# other examples that incorporate AI in different ways:

import selenium
from chatgpt_api import generate_crawling_strategy
from multiprocessing import Pool

# Initialize Selenium drivers
drivers = [
    selenium.webdriver.Chrome(),
    selenium.webdriver.Firefox(),
    # ...
]

# Define the starting URLs
start_urls = [
    "https://example.com/page1",
    "https://example.com/page2",
    # ...
]

# Use ChatGPT API to generate a crawling strategy
crawling_strategy = generate_crawling_strategy(start_urls)

# Define the crawling function
def crawl(driver, strategy):
    # Implement the crawling strategy using Selenium
    # ...

# Create a pool of worker processes
pool = Pool(processes=len(drivers))

# Distribute the crawling tasks across multiple processes
results = [pool.apply_async(crawl, args=(driver, crawling_strategy)) for driver in drivers]

# Wait for the tasks to complete
[result.get() for result in results]
